          EAS Neighborhood NFTs have the ability to earn significant revenue without needing to be traded. Neighborhood NFTs represent the aggregate grouping of <strong>all individual Address NFTs within a specific postal code</strong>. That means owners of Neighborhood NFTs receive a 10% royalty on new mint sales and a 1% royalty on all trading and commercial revenue generated from any EAS Address NFT or Charity NFT within its respective neighborhood (postal code). Address and Charity NFTs with no designated postal code will not be included in the Neighborhood NFT royalty structure.
