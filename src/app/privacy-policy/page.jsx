                information, browser type, and settings and information about

                device and application identification numbers, location, browser
                type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile

                imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type
                and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For

                geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on
                your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this
                information either by refusing access to the information or by

                is, or may be victim of financial abuse
              </li>
              <li>
                If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent
                would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the
                information and the collection is reasonable for purposes
                related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a
                contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
              </li>

              </li>
              <li>
                If it was produced by an individual in the course of their
                employment, business, or profession and the collection is
                consistent with the purposes for which the information was
                produced
              </li>
              <li>
                If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or
                literary purposes
              </li>
              <li>
                If the information is publicly available and is specified by the
                regulations
              </li>

            <p>
              In Short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to
              collect and store your information.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web
              beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific
              information about how we use such technologies and how you can
              refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.
            </p>
            <h3>6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h3>
            <p>
              In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our Services
              using a social media account, we may have access to certain
              information about you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using
              your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook
              or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive
              certain profile information about you from your social media
              provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on
              the social media provider concerned, but will often include your
              name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as
              other information you choose to make public on such a social media
              platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that
              are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made
              clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not
              control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal
              information by your third-party social media provider. We
              recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how
              they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how
              you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.
            </p>
            <h3>7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
            <p>
              In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to
              fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless
              otherwise required by law.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
              necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless
              a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as
              tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this
              notice will require us keeping your personal information for
              longer than the period of time in which users have an account with
              us.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
              personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
              information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because
              your personal information has been stored in backup archives),
              then we will securely store your personal information and isolate
              it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
            </p>
            <h3>8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>
            <p>
              In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a
              system of organizational and technical security measures.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
              organizational security measures designed to protect the security
              of any personal information we process. However, despite our
              safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic
              transmission over the Internet or information storage technology
              can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or
              guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized
              third parties will not be able to defeat our security and
              improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
              Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,
              transmission of personal information to and from our Services is
              at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a
              secure environment.
            </p>

              In Short: In some regions, such as the European Economic Area
              (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Canada, you have rights that allow
              you greater access to and control over your personal information.
              You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.
            </p>
            <p>
              In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain
              rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include
              the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal
              information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to
              restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if
              applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may
              also have the right to object to the processing of your personal
              information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using
              the contact details provided in the section “HOW CAN YOU CONTACT
              US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?” below.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with
              applicable data protection laws.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are
              unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the
              right to complain to your local data protection supervisory
              authority. You can find their contact details here:

            </p>
            <p>
              Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to
              process your personal information, which may be express and/or
              implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the
              right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your
              consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details
              provided in the section “HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS

            </p>
            <p>
              However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of
              the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law
              allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information
              conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than
              consent.

              Opting out of marketing and promotional communications: You can

              still communicate with you — for example, to send you
              service-related messages that are necessary for the administration
              and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for
              other non-marketing purposes.

            <h3>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
            <p>
              Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
              applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you
              can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
              about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At
              this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
              implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
              currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism
              that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
              online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must
              follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a
              revised version of this privacy notice.

            <p>
              Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity
              to determine you are the same person about whom we have the
              information in our system. These verification efforts require us
              to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with
              information you have previously provided us. For instance,
              depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to
              provide certain information so that we can match the information
              you provide with the information we already have on file, or we
              may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or
              email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use
              other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will only use personal information provided in your request to
              verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the
              extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information
              from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot
              verify your identity from the information already maintained by
              us, we may request that you provide additional information for the
              purposes of verifying your identity and for security or
              fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally
              provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.
