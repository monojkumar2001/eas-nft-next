      content:`
      <p>EAS is mapping the world’s addresses as tradable NFTs.</p>
       <p>Ethereum Address Service (EAS) NFTs are the keys to unlock value in our digital world. With EAS, NFT owners build digital address collections and participate in the monetization of the data associated with buying and trading. We envision a future where every real-world address and point of interest has an associated EAS NFT.</p>
       <p>EAS serves as the platform to monetize and manage these new digital address rights and drive price appreciation for NFT buyers. At its core, EAS is a merging of the physical world with a digital one (“phygital”), creating new opportunities for the representation and commercialization of the property we can see and touch.</p>
       <p>EAS NFTS are minted on the Ethereum blockchain as ERC-1155 tokens and instantly tradable on <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/ethereum-address-service" target="_blank">OpenSea </a> </span>. or the secondary market of your choice.</p>

      title: "On which blockchain are EAS NFTs printed & what type of token is utilized?",
      content: `EAS NFTS are minted on the Ethereum blockchain as ERC-1155 tokens. ERC-1155 tokens can facilitate batch transfers, allowing for the purchase of multiple EAS Address NFTs as one transaction, reducing network congestion and lowering gas costs by up to 90%. We do not use ERC-721 due to the need for transactions to be created for individual NFTs, leading to slow inefficient transactions and higher gas fees.`,
